# Gesture-Controlled Robotic Arm

This project demonstrates a real-time hand gesture controlled robotic arm using Python and OpenCV. The system captures live video input, detects hand gestures, and translates them into smooth robotic arm movements.

## Problem Statement
Traditional robotic control systems rely on buttons or joysticks. This project enables natural and intuitive human-machine interaction using vision-based gesture recognition.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Arduino

## Key Features
- Real-time hand landmark detection
- Gesture stabilization to reduce noise
- Optimized frame processing for better performance
- Smooth robotic arm control

## Performance Optimization
- Reduced unnecessary frame computations
- Used gesture consistency checks across frames
- Improved response time and FPS

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the project:
   python main.py
